#Probability functions

#Binomial probabilities
#general form
dbinom (events, total, probability)

#Example 5.8
#probabilities of 4, 5 and 6 males per litter of 6
dbinom (4,6,0.5)
dbinom (5,6,0.5)
dbinom (6,6,0.5)

#cumultive binomial brobabilities
#general form 
pbinom(events, total, probability, lower.tail)
#lower.tail defines whether you want ? or > total

#four or fewer
pbinom(4,6,0.5, FALSE)

#more than 4
pbinom(4,6,0.5, TRUE)


#Poisson probabilities
#general form (as with binomial)
dpois (number of occurrences, mean)
ppois(number of occurrences, mean, lower.tail)

#example 5.4
#probability of 2 seedlings per plot
dpois(2, 1.41)

#cumulative probability of 2 or fewer seedlings per plot
ppois(2, 1.41, TRUE)

#cumulative probability of more than 2 seedling per plot
ppois(2, 1.41, FALSE)
