#Additional ANOVA designs

#models defined as before (chapter 11)


#Randomized block design
#the + adds a term to the model without calculating interactions

#data for example 12.1
#the factor(variable) treats the litter number as discreet groups
#by default, R would treat this as a continuous variable
diet.mod <- aov(Gain ~ Diet + factor(Litter), data=Ex12_1)
anova(diet.mod)
summary(lm(diet.mod))


#Block design for repeated measures

#data for example 12.2
brood.mod <- aov(Time ~ factor(Day) + factor(Male), data=Ex12_2)
anova(brood.mod)
summary(lm(diet.mod))


#Factorial design

# data for example 12.4, a 2-way ANOVA
#the * between factors will calculate an interaction 
bill.mod <- aov(Length ~ Region*Gender, data=EX12_5)
anova(bill.mod)
summary(lm(bill.mod))

#an interaction plot to visualize the model
#General form
interaction.plot(x-axis, lines, response)

#for example 12.4
interaction.plot(Ex12_5$Region,Ex12_5$Gender, Ex12_5$Length)


#Friedman's test – nonparametric randomized block design
